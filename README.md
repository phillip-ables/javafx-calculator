# javafx-calculator
simple javafx calculator

so I tried a Java Jframe calculator and worked on it all day and didn't know how to include its class into the main class.
Since im too lazy to look up how to invoke a class
I thought
I'm just gonna help solidify what I learned by coding it agian in JavaFx

Here ya go!!
I hope you like it as much as I do
